# cnn-image-filtering-and-differentiation
This project implements image filtering techniques using Gaussian kernels, padding strategies, and convolution operations. It also explores forward-mode and reverse-mode automatic differentiation for scalar values. The project combines core principles of image processing and automatic differentiation for CNNs.
